Flickr::API2
============

Perl interface to the Flickr API.

This module is based on Flickr::API by Cal Henderson, forked and updated.

Changes from Version 1:

 * Update API URLs to api.flickr.com
 * Remove XML libraries
 * Return Perl structure
 * Use JSON API at Flickr
 * Update inheritance methods
 * Fix dependencies
 * Use Module::Install instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker
 * Add unit tests
 * Throw exceptions when deserved rather than return a hash containing
   a "not ok" field in it.
 * Remove the subclassed HTTP::Response object as your main returned item.
 * Some initial helper methods to directly access photos/searches.

Still to come:

 * More helper methods and classes.
